Question 3
<stmt> →  <op> <var> <stmt>
<stmt> →  <op> <var> <var>
<letter> → [A-Z|a-z]{<num>} 
<var> → [<letter>|<num>] 
<op> → [‘+’|‘-’|‘/’|‘*’|‘%’] 
<num> → [0-9]{<num>}
Any bottom-up parser would suffice as the process of a bottom-up parser starts with the last sentential form
and produces the sequence of sentential form there until all that remains is the start symbol. For example,
A+B/C*D would be read in preorder form which is +AB/*CD and from there would be parsed bottom-up. 

Question 4
Static scoping which was introduced in ALGOL 60 is the method of binding names to nonlocal variables. 
It is named that because the scope of a variable can be statically determined prior to the execution.
Dynamic scoping only occurs if the first binding occurs during runtime and could change in the course of 
program execution. With dnyamic type binding 
It would not matter for both and dynamic scoping because the symbol table would be different for both, 
so the type of scoping would not change the answer. 

Question 5
I would implement a hashmap or a heap in which I would implement a fucntion that would read a fle and
compare the strings and character values to the hashmap or heap in order to analyize and assign tokens.
I would allow users to add their own reserved words to the hashmap or heap. Nothing would change in the 
code besides that added fucntion.

Question 6
<while_stmt> → "while" "(" <bool_stmt> ")" "{" <block> "}"
<if_stmt> → "if" "(" <bool_stmt> ")" [<stmt> | "{" <block> "}"]
{["else" "if" "(" <bool_stmt> ")" [<stmt | "{" <block> "}" ]]}
(["else" [<stmt> | "{" <block> "}"])
<assign> → <var> "=" [<var> | <const> | <func> | "null"]
<block> → {<stmt>}
<stmt> →  <op> <var> <stmt>
<stmt> →  <op> <var> <var>
<letter> → [A-Z|a-z]{<num>} 
<var> → [<letter>|<num>] 
<op> → [‘+’|‘-’|‘/’|‘*’|‘%’] 
<num> → [0-9]{<num>}

Question 7

Question 8
In static scoping the variable always refers to its top level environment, which is just a property of
the program text. In dynamic scoping a global identifier refers to the identifier associated with the most
recent environment. Meaning that each identifier has a global stack of bindings and the occurence of a identifier
is searched in the most recent binding. Perl's keyword "my" defines a statically scoped variable, while 
the keyword "local" defines a dynamically scoped variable.[1]
